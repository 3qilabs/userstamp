      <h1>Userstamp Plugin (v 2.0)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Userstamp Plugin extends <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord::Base</a>
to add automatic updating of &#8216;creator&#8217;, &#8216;updater&#8217;,
and &#8216;deleter&#8217; attributes. It is based loosely on the <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Timestamp.html">ActiveRecord::Timestamp</a>
module.
</p>
<p>
Two class methods (&#8216;acts_as_stamper&#8217; and
&#8216;acts_as_stampable&#8217;) are implemented in this plugin. The
acts_as_stamper method is used in models that are responsible for creating,
updating, or deleting other objects. The acts_as_stampable method is used
in models that are subject to being created, updated, or deleted by
&#8216;stampers&#8217;.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Installation of the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin
script. Issue the following command from the root of your application:
</p>
<pre>
  script/plugin install git://github.com/delynn/userstamp.git
</pre>
<p>
Once installed you will need to restart your application for the plugin to
be loaded into the Rails environment.
</p>
<p>
You might also be interested in using <a
href="http://piston.rubyforge.org/index.html">Piston</a> to manage the
importing and future updating of this plugin.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
In this new version of the Userstamp plug-in, the assumption is that you
have two different categories of objects; those that manimpulate, and those
that are manipulated. For those objects that are being manipulated
there&#8216;s the ActsAsStampable module and for the manipulators
there&#8216;s the ActsAsStamper module. There&#8216;s also the actual
Userstamp module for your controllers that assists in setting up your
environment on a per request basis.
</p>
<p>
To better understand how all this works, I think an example is in order.
For this example we will assume that we are creating a weblog application
that is comprised of User and Post objects. Since Users manipulate Posts,
we&#8216;ll do the following:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_stamper
  end
</pre>
<p>
And Posts are manipulated by Users, so it should look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_stampable
  end
</pre>
<p>
Now we just need to setup our controllers to set the current user of the
application. It&#8216;s recommended that you do this in your
ApplicationController (or a controller that all your stamper objects
inherit from):
</p>
<pre>
  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
    include Userstamp
  end
</pre>
<p>
So, what did we just do? The acts_as_stamper class method injects two
methods into the User class. They are stamper= and stamper and look like
this:
</p>
<pre>
  def stamper=(object)
    object_stamper = if object.is_a?(ActiveRecord::Base)
      object.send(&quot;#{object.class.primary_key}&quot;.to_sym)
    else
      object
    end

    Thread.current[&quot;#{self.to_s.downcase}_#{self.object_id}_stamper&quot;] = object_stamper
  end

  def stamper
    Thread.current[&quot;#{self.to_s.downcase}_#{self.object_id}_stamper&quot;]
  end
</pre>
<p>
The big change with this new version is that we are now using
Thread.current to save the current stamper so as to avoid conflict with
concurrent requests.
</p>
<p>
The Userstamp module that we included into our ApplicationController uses
the setter method to tell the set which user is currently making the
request. By default the &#8216;set_stampers&#8217; method looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
  def set_stampers
    User.stamper = self.current_user
  end
</pre>
<p>
This implementation assumes you are using ActsAsAuthenticated, but you can
obviously change over-ride this method to better match your implementation.
</p>
<p>
Now, let&#8216;s get back to ActsAsStampable (since it really is the
interesting one). If you&#8216;ve already created your database with
columns called &#8216;creator_id&#8217;, &#8216;updater_id&#8217; and
&#8216;deleter_id&#8217;, and you&#8216;re Stamper object is
&#8216;User&#8217; than your set and ready to go. ActsAsStampable sets up
before_* filters that are responsible for setting those attributes at the
appropriate times. It also creates the belongs_to relationships for you.
</p>
<p>
If you need to use something different the method can be completely
customized. Here&#8216;s an example of how you would upgrade an application
currently using the initial version of the plugin:
</p>
<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_stampable :stamper_class_name =&gt; :person,
                      :creator_attribute  =&gt; :created_by,
                      :updater_attribute  =&gt; :updated_by,
                      :deleter_attribute  =&gt; :deleted_by
  end
</pre>
<h2>Uninstall</h2>
<p>
Uninstalling the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script.
Issue the following command from the root of your application:
</p>
<pre>
  script/plugin remove userstamp
</pre>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
RDoc has been run on the plugin directory and is available in the doc
directory.
</p>
<h2>Running Unit Tests</h2>
<p>
There are extensive unit tests in the &quot;test&quot; directory of the
plugin.
</p>
<h2>Bugs &amp; Feedback</h2>
<p>
Bug reports and feedback are welcome via my delynn+userstamp@gmail.com
email address. I also encouraged everyone to clone the git repository and
make modifications&#8212;I&#8216;ll be more than happy to merge any changes
from other people&#8216;s branches that would be beneficial to the whole
project.
</p>
<h2>Credits and Special Thanks</h2>
<p>
The original idea for this plugin came from the Rails Wiki article entitled

ActiveRecord</a>.
